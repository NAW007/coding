<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">Safari Zoo Run was conceived to commemorate Singapore Zoo's famous matriarch and one of Singapore's most loved animal personalities - Ah Meng the Sumatran orangutan, who passed on due to old age in February 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">The run encourages family bonding while empowering runners to support wildlife conservation. Come experience this unique opportunity to run through Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari in the day with your family and friends! It's the only place you will be able to run alongside wildlife like orangutans and giraffes. Runners can expect more in this edition of Safari Zoo Run with the introduction of new race categories and sustainable initiatives which require your support!</p>

<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">Returning for the 11th year, Safari Zoo Run 2019 continues to inspire and deepen appreciation for wildlife. The theme for the upcoming year is <span style="color:#8B4513"><em><b>Run for Wildlife</b></em></span>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">Each of the park icons will champion a conservation cause. Runners will be able to choose which team they want to run for when they register!
